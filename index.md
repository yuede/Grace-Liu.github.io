## Guyue (Grace) Liu
{% include social.html %}

&nbsp;

Welcome! I'm Guyue Liu, a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science, [George Washington University](http://www.gwu.edu/). I am part of the [Cloud Systems Lab](https://cloudlab.seas.gwu.edu/) and my advisor is [Prof. Timothy Wood](http://faculty.cs.gwu.edu/~timwood/wiki/doku.php). Prior to joining GWU, I received my B.S. from [Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications](http://english.bupt.edu.cn/) in 2012.

My research interests include Network Function Virtualization (NFV), Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Cloud Platform.

**I will be doing a 2016 Summer Internship at Hewlett Packard Labs.**
